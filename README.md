## Usage

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="awsm.min.css">
```

Also don't forget to add viewport info to the `<head>` for adaptation to mobile. Like this:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

And if you want to get beautiful fonts, add “PT Serif” from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Serif).

## Why?

I have to create simple pages in my daily work. Sometimes it's compiled Markdown and sometimes it's pure HTML. I'd like to make them more beautiful without additional classes, ids, etc. So I did it.

## Examples

[Website for this repo](https://igoradamenko.github.io/awsm.css/) uses awsm.css. Check this out.
