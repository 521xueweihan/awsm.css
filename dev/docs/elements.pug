  section#main
    h2 Main blocks

    p
      | awsm.css contains styles for all really useful HTML5 skeleton tags.
      | If you open the source code of this page you'll see all of them (except
      = ''
      code article
      = ' '
      | but there are styles for it too).

    h3 What about others?

    aside One should note here that you can write on the margin.

    figure
      img(src="images/cat.jpg", alt="Kitty")

      figcaption
        code figure
        = ' '
        | with kitten for your pleasure

    p
      code div
      = ' '
      | blocks are not styled because they don't have semantic value (as well as
      = ' '
      code span
      = ' '
      | elements which aren't styled either)

    p But quotes are really nice:

      a(
        href="http://html5doctor.com/cite-and-blockquote-reloaded/",
        title="An article on html5doctor.com explains the right way of using quotes in HTML5"
      ) cite and blockquote – reloaded

    blockquote
      p See, you not only have to be a good coder to create a system like Linux, you have to be a sneaky bastard too.

      footer
        | —
        = ' '
        cite Linus Torvalds

    p Yeah! They have absolutely no custom styles :)

  section#lists
    h2 Lists

    p There's boring unordered list of jedi masters:

    ul
      li Plo Koon
      li Qui-Gon Jinn
      li Obi-Wan Kenobi
      li Luke Skywalker
      li Aalya Secura
      li Kit Fisto
      li Ahsoka Tano
      li Anakin Skywalker
      li Mace Windu

    p Let's rank them on impact on the saga and personal accomplishments!

    p
      | You may see list wrapped by
      = ' '
      code nav
      = ' '
      | in the header of this page. And we also have description lists:

    dl
      dt Blizzard
      dd A howling blizzard is summoned to strike the opposing team. It may also freeze them solid.

      dt Hidden Power
      dd A unique attack that varies in type depending on the Pokémon using it.

      dt Waterfall
      dd The user charges at the target and may make it flinch. It can also be used to climb a waterfall.

  section#tables
    h2 Tables

    p For instance let's look at Apple, Microsoft & Google:

    table
      caption Comparison of IT giants

      thead
        tr
          th Title
          th Revenue
          th CEO
          th Founders

      tbody
        tr
          td Apple
          td US$ 182.795 billion
          td Tim Cook
          td Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Ronald Wayne

        tr
          td Microsoft
          td US$ 93.58 billion
          td Satya Nadella
          td Bill Gates, Paul Allen

        tr
          td Google
          td US$ 66.001 billion
          td Larry Page
          td Larry Page, Sergey Brin

      tfoot
        tr
          td(colspan="4") Total revenue: US$ 342.376 billion

  section#inlines
    h2 Inlines

    p
      | awsm.css contains many styles for inline elements. For example
      = ' '
      dfn omfg
      = ' '
      | is abbreviation which means “Oh my fucking God!”. It's one of the most popular
      = ' '
      abbr(title='World Wide Web') WWW
      = ' '
      | abbreviation.

    p
      | Of course the library has styles for
      = ' '
      strong strong
      = ' '
      | and
      = ' '
      em emphasized
      = ' '
      | text. It doesn't have something special for
      = ' '
      code b
      = ' '
      | and
      = ' '
      code i
      = ' '
      | because in HTML5 they are only semantical elements. So they are same as
      = ' '
      code strong
      = ' '
      | and
      = ' '
      code em
      | .

    p
      | If some part of the text is outdated you can
      = ' '
      del delete this
      = ' '
      | and
      = ' '
      ins insert actual version
      | . You also can mark
      = ' '
      mark important thought
      | .

    p
      img(src="images/surprised-cat.jpg", alt="Surprised cat")
      | Please note if you insert image inside
      = ' '
      code p
      = ' '
      | it'll be aligned to the right. And all paragraphs after it will flow around the picture on the left.
      | But if you insert image outside
      = ' '
      code p
      = ' '
      | it'll be aligned to the center. You may see example below.

    hr

    p
      | Above you've seen examples of using tags for quoting (
      code blockquote
      = ' '
      | &
      = ' '
      code cite
      | ). There is another one tag. It's
      = ' '
      code q
      | . Imagine that we hear the song:
      = ' '
      q Soft Kitty, Warm Kitty, little ball of fur.. Happy Kitty, Sleepy Kitty, purr, purr, purr
      | .

    p
      | And don't forget about attribute
      = ' '
      code lang
      = ' '
      | of this tag. Quotes depend on it. For instance in Russian quotes are different:
      = ' '
      q(lang="ru") Теплый пушистый котенок спит, свернулся в клубочек и мурчит
      | .
