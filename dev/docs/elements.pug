    p And we also have description lists:

      dt Blizzard
      dd A howling blizzard is summoned to strike the opposing team. It may also freeze them solid.

      dt Hidden Power
      dd A unique attack that varies in type depending on the Pokémon using it.

      dt Waterfall
      dd The user charges at the target and may make it flinch. It can also be used to climb a waterfall.
